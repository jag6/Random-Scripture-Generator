# Random-Scripture-Generator
Random Scripture Generator

This program will randomly select a book and accompanying chapter from the Bible. 
The program logic can be used to iterate over any type of key value pair that you desire, so feel free to customize the generator with a different set of data.

The program will only work if either Python, Ruby or Node.js has been previously installed on your computer. 
It can be run from the terminal by simply typing in either:
<ul>
  <li>python rsg.py (use python3 rsg.py if python rsg.py doesn't work)</li>
  <li>ruby rsg.rb</li>
  <li>node rsg.js</li>
</ul>
  
A Chinese version has only been included.
